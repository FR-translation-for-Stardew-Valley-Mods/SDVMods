## Blood Moon

A blood moon is a rare event in Pelican Town. It only appears to happen 1 in 67 times on a full moon, and 1 in 800 times on a waning or waxing gibbeous moon. During this event, you can spot it by the red fog and red water. In addition, shopkeepers are often more anxious and drive harder bargins. Outside, monsters roam.

Thankfully, they don't appear to spawn on wedding and festival days..
