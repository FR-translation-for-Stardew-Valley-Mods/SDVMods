This repository contains my SMAPI mods for Stardew Valley. See the individual mods for

## Translating My Mods

Here's how to translate one of my mods:

1. Copy `default.json` into a new file with the right name:

   language   | file name
   ---------- | ---------
   Chinese    | `zh.json`
   German     | `de.json`
   Japanese   | `ja.json`
   Portuguese | `pt.json`
   Spanish    | `es.json`

2. Translate the second part on each line:
   ```json
   "example-key": "some text here"
                   ^-- translate this
   ```
   Don't change the quote characters, and don't translate the text inside `{{these brackets}}`.
3. Launch the game to try your translations.  
   _You can edit translations without restarting the game; just type `reload_i18n` in the SMAPI console to reload the translation files._

Create an issue or pull request here with your translations, or send them to me privately. :)

## Compiling the mods
Installing stable releases from Nexus Mods is recommended for most users. If you really want to
compile the mod yourself, read on.

These mods use the [crossplatform build config](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig)
so they can be built on Linux, Mac, and Windows without changes. See [the build config documentation](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Pathoschild.Stardew.ModBuildConfig)
for troubleshooting.

### Compiling a mod for testing
To compile a mod and add it to your game's `Mods` directory:

1. Rebuild the project in [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/) or [MonoDevelop](http://www.monodevelop.com/).  
   <small>This will compile the code and package it into the mod directory.</small>
2. Launch the project with debugging.  
   <small>This will start the game through SMAPI and attach the Visual Studio debugger.</small>

### Compiling a mod for release
To package a mod for release:

1. Switch to `Release` build configuration.
2. Recompile the mod per the previous section.
3. Upload the generated `bin/Release/<mod name>-<version>.zip` file from the project folder.
