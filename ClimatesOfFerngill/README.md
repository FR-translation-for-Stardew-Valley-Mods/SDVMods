# Climates of Ferngill (Rebuild) You Can (Not) Have Weather

Current Version (20 October 2017): v1.1.12p3 beta

## What's New

- Fog!
- Blizzards, Thundersnow
- A more customizable weather system
 
## Overview

This mod does the following:

- Alters the weather via a custom method that can read custom files
- Adds in several custom weathers - Thundersnow! Blizzards! Dry Lightning!
- Changes the rain totem to occasionally spawm storms as well.
- Adds a moon overhead, which will act on the world
- Adds a weather menu option, which will display information about the weather
- Changes the text for the TV weather channel
- Going out in storms, blizzards, frosts and heatwaves is now more perilous, as it drains your stamina. Thankfully, 
    a 'Muscle Remedy' has been found to cure even the hardiest flu

##Requirements

- Stardew Valley: 1.2.33+
- SMAPI: 1.15.4+ 

## Config Options

- `ClimateType` - set to weather that has a corresponding file in `data\weather\`. Packaged with the mod is
`normal`, `extended`, `arid`, `dry`, `wet`, `monsoon`. Default: `normal`.

- `ThundersnowOdds` - This controls the odds of thundersnow. (Custom weather available during the snow.) Valid: 0-1, but it's 
recommended that this is kept low. Default: `.001` (.1%)

- `BlizzardOdds` - This controls the odds of blizzards (Custom weather available during the snow.). Valid 0-1, but it's 
recommended that this is kept low. Default: `.08` (8%)

- `DryLightning` - This controls the odds of dry lightning (Custom weather available during any clear day, as long as the temperature is 
over a certain value.). Valid 0-1, but it's recommended that this is kept low. Default: `.1` (10%)

- `DryLightningMinTemp` - This controls the minimum temperature to trigger the DryLightning event. 
  Defaults to `34`. Values are in Celsius. (34 C is 93.2 F)

- 'TooColdOutside' - This controls the temperature required (the *low* temperature required) to trigger the Frost event. Note this is a Spring and Fall event, and will potentially kill crops
  Defaults to '-3'. Values are in Celsius (1 C is 33.8 F). 
  NOTE: Frosts trigger at dark

- 'TooHotOutside' - This controls the temperature required (the *high* temperature required) to trigger the Heatwave event.
  Defaults to '39'. Values are in Celsius (39 C is 102.2 F)
  NOTE : Heatwaves taper off at night.

- `SnowOnFall28` - If set to true, this will force snow fall and appropriate temperatures on Fall 28. Default: `false`,
  Valid: `true` or `false`

- `StormTotemChange` - Usage of the rain totem will now spawn storms with the same odds as spawning storms on 
   rainy days. Default: `true`. Valid: `true` or `false`.

- `Verbose` - This makes the mod noisy to provide a lot of debug options. Default: `false`. Valid: `true` or `false`.

- `AllowStormsSpringYear1` - Default: `false`. Normally, you can't get storms in Spring Y1. This keeps that valid. Valid: `true` or 
 `false`

- `DisplayBothScales` - Default: `false`. This will display both known scales. Set to `true`, if you want to see Farenheit as well.

- `HazardousWeather` - Default: `false`. This turns on hazardous weather. It's normally turned off. Right now, it only turns on the heatwave and frost events
	IMPORTANT NOTE: This only enables the stamina drain on them, and the dewatering of the heatwave. Frost's crop death will remain disabled, 
	as well not watering the plants in time for a heatwave.

- `AllowCropDeath` - Default: `false`. Normally, hazardous weather won't kill crops, just stop them growing. This reenables crop death.'

- 'AffectedOutside' - The percentage outside you need to be within a 10 minute span to be affected by stamina events.
 Defaults to '.65', valid values are between 0 and 1. To turn stamina drains off entirely, set it to 0. 

 - 'SickMoreThanOnce' - By default, the false means you can only get sick once a day. Set it to true to be affected by multiple colds.

 - 'StaminaDrain' - This is an int containing the default stamina drain for hazardous events. See the writeup (soon) for more information. Default is '2'. Valid range is any number between foo and bar.'

 - 'DeadCropPercentage' - The amount of crops that a heatwave and frost can kill. (Note: Frost will kill more than heatwaves). Default: '.1' Valid range is 0 to 1.

 - 'CropResistance' - This represents the resistance an averagecrop has to heatwaves. Frosts have half this resistance. Default: '.4' Valid Range is 0 to 1.

 - 'DarkFogChance' - This controls the chance of the darker fog appearing. Default is set to '.0875' (or a 1/8th chance if it's foggy it'll be dark fog.) Valid Range is 0 to 1.

 - 'ChanceOfGettingSick' - Controls the chance you'll get sick when conditions are matched. Default is set to '.7' for (70% chance). Valid Range is 0 to 1.
