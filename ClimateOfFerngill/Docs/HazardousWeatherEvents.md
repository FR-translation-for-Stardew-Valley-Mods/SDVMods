# Hazardous Weather Events

The mod has several right now: Frost, Blizzard and Heatwaves. All of these events require `HarshWeather` in the config to be set to true

## Frost

The mod checks against the low temp, and then kills them at night. In order to ensure that you don't have a full die off (you can edit this to create a full die off), the variable `FrostHardiness` in the configuration controls if things die. It's set to .45, which means 45% of all crops die. To make more crops die, increase it, to make less crops dies, decrease it.
