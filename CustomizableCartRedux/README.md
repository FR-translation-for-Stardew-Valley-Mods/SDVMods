##  Customizable Traveling Cart Redux

This mod is inspired by yyeahdude. It allows you to set the chances of the traveling cart appearing per day (by setting it from 0 to 1, for example, a 25% chance is .25), the items it contains, and how much it is.

## API documentation

This mod provides an API if people want to add items to the cart. 

The interface looks like:

    public interface ICustomizableCart
    {
        event EventHandler CartProcessingComplete;
        void AddItem(Item item, int price, int quality);
    }


***Important Note***: `AddItem` is meant for more advanced uses outside of the handler, but we strongly recommend you call it only with the handler.
The API defaults the last to 1, but it can be passed in if you want a different number. This interface is from 1.2.2+

In order to add items, subscribe to the CartProcessingComplete event, and put your logic for adding items there.
