# Lunar Disturbances

## Current Version:

1.1

## Requirements

- SMAPI 3.0+
- Stardew Valley 1.4+

## This Mod Does:

- Adds a moon overhead, which will act on the world - occasionally helping your crops, occasionally hurting your crops, as well as acting on how many items wash up on the beach. During a full moon, more rare items may wash up..
- Adds a blood moon, which will spawn monsters, make things more expensive, and people irritable
- On rare new moons, you get an eclipse.

## Multiplayer

Works only for the host player. Most of the events should affect farmhands.

## Compatiblity

Compatible by default with JsonAssets, and if you have PriceDrops installed, will run after it to allow both of their effects to work. 

Price alterations under the blood moon may be incompatible with other mods that alter store prices. (in that one or the other won't do anything.)
